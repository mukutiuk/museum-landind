The landing page is designed and developed using **JavaScript**, **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **SCSS**, and **SASS** technologies, ensuring strict adherence to the design in Figma. The header and footer menus contain links that seamlessly navigate users to corresponding sections of the landing page. Consistent animation speed is maintained across the entire page for a cohesive user experience.

Form **placeholders**  provide clear guidance on data input, and form **validation** prompts users on the correct format for input, including **phone numbers**. The social media icons for **Facebook** and Instagram in the footer are interactive and open the museum's respective social profiles in a new tab upon clicking.

In the **gallery** and **exhibitions** sections, images enlarge smoothly on hover, enhancing the visual experience for users. Additionally, a smooth feature is implemented for seamless navigation throughout the entire landing page.
